This is a simple program to unscramble letters.

The main purpose of the program is to aid in games such as scrabble, 
words with friends, etc. A user simply enters their letters, and the 
program searches through a dictionary and uncovers potential words
that can be produced with the given letters. Currently, a text based 
interface exists, and a GUI is in progress. 

This project was mainly done for fun, with the intention of learning 
Python, unittesting with Python, and GUI creation in Python. 

This program was made to run on Linux (tested on Ubuntu), and requires python, pygtk, and gtk to be available on the running computer. These should be available on Ubuntu in the repositories. For Macs, python is already installed, and pygtk and gtk can be installed from here: http://afb.users.sourceforge.net/zero-install/PyGTK.pkg.
