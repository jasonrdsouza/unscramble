This is a simple program to unscramble letters.

The main purpose of the program is to aid in games such as scrabble, 
words with friends, etc. A user simply enters their letters, and the 
program searches through a dictionary and uncovers potential words
that can be produced with the given letters. Currently, a text based 
interface exists, and a GUI is in progress. 

This project was mainly done for fun, with the intention of learning 
Python, unittesting with Python, and GUI creation in Python.
