{"name":"Unscramble","body":"###This is a simple program to unscramble letters.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of the program is to aid in games such as scrabble, words with friends, etc. A user simply enters their letters, and the program searches through a dictionary and uncovers potential words that can be produced with the given letters. Currently, a text based interface exists, and a GUI is in progress. \r\n\r\nThis project was mainly done for fun, with the intention of learning Python, unittesting with Python, and GUI creation in Python. \r\n\r\nThis program was made to run on Linux (tested on Ubuntu), and requires python, pygtk, and gtk to be available on the running computer. These should be available on Ubuntu in the repositories. \r\n\r\nFor Macs, python is already installed, and pygtk and gtk can be installed from here: http://afb.users.sourceforge.net/zero-install/PyGTK.pkg.\r\n\r\nFor Windows, python must be installed from (http://www.python.org/getit/windows/), and the necessary libraries can be installed from (http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html). The all-in-one installer is the simplest option.\r\n\r\nAuthor: Jason D'Souza\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
